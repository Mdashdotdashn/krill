From the model, we can establish a render tree composed of operator combining segments

Event {
  time_
  [Values]
}

Lane {
  [ Events ]
  cycleLength_;
  targetName_;
}

Operator
{
  arguments_;
  [Operators] childs_;

  render -> op(childs.render) ->[Lanes]
}

Operators transforms a group of child lanes into another group of lanes

A player interacts with all the lanes

Player {
  [LanePlayer]
}
