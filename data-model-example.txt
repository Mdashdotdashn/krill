From the model, we can establish a render tree composed of operator combining segments

Event {
  time_
  [Values]
}

Lane {
  [ Events ]
  cycleLength_;
  targetName_;
}

Segment {
  [Lanes]
}


Rendering a segment leads to a single timeline of automation

AutomationValue {
  targetName_
  [ Values ]
}

AutomationPoint {
  time_;
  [ AutomationValues ]
}

AutomationTimeline {
  [AutomationPoints ]
}
