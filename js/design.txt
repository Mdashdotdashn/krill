The overall goal is to transform a sequence of command / code into a pattern
of events. Events happen at given time, referred to as Fraction of a global
"cycle" (typically a bar)

e.g.
"bd hh sd hh"
    ->  "bd" at 0
        "hh" at 1/4
        "sd" at 1/2
        "hh" at 3/4

These events can then be played back through some 'device'

The transformation of the string original data is done in steps:
  1- transformation of the input into structured data (through pegjs)
  2- the construction of a rendering tree made of operators
  3- the rendering tree is passed on to players that renders it in order to
     play the generated events

The render tree is made of a hierarchy of node where each node transform its
children's node data. Node can either be a Patterns (sequence of event). Or an
operator (transforms the childrens)

  [node1]
     |  +---- [node 11]
     |
  [node2]
     |  +---- [node 21]
     |


Operators implement the following API:
  +-----------------------------------------------+
  |   Operator                                    |
  |   - tick() // advances to next state          |
  |   - render() // returns a playable sequence   |
  +-----------------------------------------------+

  where tick() advance to the next state
    (if any - usually triggered when the event array is consumed)
  while render() return the whole array of event to be played in the form of a
    Sequence:

Patterns: sequence of events with a fractional time within the sequence
    +------------------------------------------------+
    |   Pattern                                     |
    |   o cycleLength_  // length of the data        |
    |   o events_ // array of events to be triggered |
    |     (all times are in fraction of the cycle)   |
    +------------------------------------------------+

Sequence: An operator representing a timeline of nodes. The elements of the
          timeline can be 'weighted' so that each element can have it's own
          spacing within the timeline
